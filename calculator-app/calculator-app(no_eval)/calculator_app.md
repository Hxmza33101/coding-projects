# Calculator App (no eval())

Within this folder is code for the calculator app that does not use the inbuilt `eval` function of JavaScript. This code is, for the most part, re-used from the calculator app which does use `eval`. As only the logic must be changed to make this valid for the constraints applied upon the coding challenge for which this is made.
